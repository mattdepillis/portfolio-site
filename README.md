# portfolio-site

This repo contains the code I'm writing to create my portfolio site. Currently, the site is still in development. I'm aiming to release it live sometime in May or early June.

## Inspiration

I started building this site not only to add another personal project to my portfolio, but also to create a place on the internet for me to showcase my interests and work. I've wanted my own website since I first became interested in software engineering... what better way to use my newfound skills than to build one for myself!

## Tech Stack

I use Notion as a content management system (CMS), [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) and notion-client + Notion's beta API to fetch and render data from Notion, and Next.js as a React framework for the site. Below I enumerate the rationale behind my decision to use each incorporated technology.

### Notion-as-a-CMS

I'm a power user of Notion for productivity and notes; I love the UI, the malleability of blocks, and their built-in databases. I figured Notion would be the perfect CMS for my personal website --

- notion as a cms -- why?
- react-notion-x + notion-client
- next.js 
- travis fischer's portfolio site for ideas about how to manage things like pageUrls, dynamic pages, etc.
